# ✋ Introduction

This project is a course project. We, students of MyDigitalSchool, worked on a robot designed to fight in a virtual arena.

Two options are available: 

You can stay on automatic mode, then the robot will move randomly and shoot by himself when he sees an enemy.
Or you can switch on manual mode, you will then see a joystick and a firing button on the administrator's page and will be able to move and shoot manually with your robot.
